# UtilityBills-Aanand

A user-friendly Xamarin.Forms application, the Utility Bills Calculator App was created to make it easier for users in various Canadian provinces and territories to calculate their electricity bills. Users can input their electricity usage during the day and at night, choose their province, and the app will accurately calculate the total usage charge, apply the applicable provincial sales tax, and provide an environmental rebate for using renewable energy. The application manages various tax rates and unique circumstances, like automatically activating the renewable energy rebate for users in British Columbia. To provide a flawless user experience, it also has a reset button and strong error handling. The app makes utility expense management transparent and simple by providing clear, comprehensive breakdowns of charges and taxes.
